# ThinkTwice-Website

This is a showcas website for ThinkTwice, a mobile app which allows post-secondary students to learn more about the environmental impact of their everyday purchases, as well as view more environmentally responsible, reasonable alternatives.

This project was developed by myself and five other SHAD Fellows at SHAD York 2019.
